### Cling - Java/Android UPnP library and tools

Cling is a UPnP-compatible software stack for Java environments. The project's goals are strict specification compliance, complete, clean and extensive APIs, as well as rich SPIs for easy customization.

The current stable release of Cling is 1.0.5 (2011-09-22), see the Changelog for a summary of improvements and the Road Map for future plans.

Read this chapter of the manual for a simple Cling usage example: http://4thline.org/projects/cling/core/manual/cling-core-manual.html#chapter.GettingStarted

## Main modules of Cling are:

# Cling Core

    An embeddable Java library that implements the UPnP Device Architecture 1.0. Use Cling Core to expose services with a UPnP remoting interface, or to write control point applications that discover UPnP devices and utilize their services. You can also integrate Cling Core as an Android UPnP/DLNA library in your applications (platform level 7/2.1 required). The full source code of the Android UPnPBrowser example of the manual can be found here. You can see the application in action in this video.
    
# Cling Support

    Optional classes and useful infrastructure for developing and controlling UPnP services with Cling Core; extensions that simplify working with UPnP media servers and renderers, NAT port mapping on routers, etc.
    
# Cling Workbench

    A desktop application for browsing UPnP devices and interacting with their services, including an HTTP gateway and WAN/LAN bridge.
    
# Cling MediaRenderer

    Standalone UPnP MediaRenderer, based on gstreamer.
